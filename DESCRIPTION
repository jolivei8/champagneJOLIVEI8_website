Description: 
    The champagneJOLIVEI8 package provides functions for modeling the volume
    of a champagne glass based on its height and radius. It includes both 
    non-vectorized and vectorized versions of the modeling function. Additionally,
    the package offers a simulation function to estimate the amount of champagne
    needed for a party based on the number of guests, glasses per guest, and 
    pouring intervals.
